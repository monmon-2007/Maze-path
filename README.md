# Maze-path

In this project, I used AI to find the shortest and the lowest cost path from one point to another using Astar Algorithm.
 
 provided is the Maze, where (.) is the path and (#) is an obstacle. and the algorithem tries to find the shortest path from point A to point B based on the Giving Mize and heuristic.
